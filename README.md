- 👋 Hi, I’m Aljosha (*ok you can call me Alex if Aljoscha is too hard to pronounce*) but on the web you can see me as @bubblegumsharkie 🦈 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding. A lot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and all that comes with it — Hibernate, Postgres, Spring, RabbitMQ etc
—  👨‍💻 Currently I work as a UI/UX Designer/Analyst but development is slowly becoming "more than a hobby"
